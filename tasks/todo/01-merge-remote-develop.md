# Task: Merge Remote develop Branch Changes

## Priority: HIGH

## Estimated Time: 30 minutes

## Context

Remote develop branch has 18 new commits with major improvements:

- Large-scale lint cleanup (90%+ error reduction)
- CI/CD workflow improvements
- Documentation structure enhancements

## Pre-requisites

- [ ] Ensure current branch is develop: `git branch --show-current`
- [ ] Check for uncommitted changes: `git status`
- [ ] If uncommitted changes exist, stash them: `git stash`

## Steps

### 1. Fetch Latest Changes

```bash
git fetch origin develop
```

### 2. Review Changes Before Merge

```bash
# Review commit history
git log --oneline HEAD..origin/develop

# Check file changes summary
git diff --stat HEAD..origin/develop

# Review specific critical files
git diff HEAD..origin/develop -- .golangci.yml Makefile
```

### 3. Merge Remote Changes

```bash
# Merge with commit (recommended)
git merge origin/develop

# OR if you prefer rebase (only if no local commits)
git rebase origin/develop
```

### 4. Handle Merge Conflicts (if any)

- [ ] Resolve conflicts in `.golangci.yml` - Accept remote version (simplified config)
- [ ] Resolve conflicts in `Makefile` - Keep both local and remote changes
- [ ] Run `git add <resolved-files>` after resolving
- [ ] Complete merge: `git merge --continue`

### 5. Post-Merge Verification

```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
make bootstrap

# Run new lint configuration
make lint-all

# Run tests to ensure everything works
make test

# Check for any remaining lint issues
make check-consistency
```

### 6. Apply Stashed Changes (if any)

```bash
git stash pop
```

## Expected Outcomes

- [ ] Local develop branch is up-to-date with remote
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Lint checks pass with new configuration
- [ ] Build succeeds: `make build`

## Troubleshooting

- If lint fails: Run `make fmt` first, then `make lint`
- If tests fail: Check changed test files with `git diff HEAD~1 -- *_test.go`
- If build fails: Run `go mod tidy` and retry

## Next Steps

After successful merge, proceed to:

- Task 02: Setup new CI/CD workflows locally
- Task 03: Implement bulk-clone performance improvements
