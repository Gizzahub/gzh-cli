## Automated Security Scanning

This project implements comprehensive automated security scanning:

### Continuous Security Monitoring

- **gosec**: Static security analyzer for Go code
- **golangci-lint**: Integrated security linters
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Security checks before every commit
- **Dependency scanning**: Vulnerability detection in dependencies

### Security Scanning Commands

```bash
# Run comprehensive security analysis
make security

# Generate detailed JSON security report
make security-json

# Run all linters including security checks
make lint

# Install and run pre-commit security hooks
make pre-commit-install
make pre-commit
```

## Security Guidelines

### For Contributors

1. **Run security scans** before submitting pull requests
2. **Address security issues** found by automated tools
3. **Use `#nosec` comments** sparingly and with clear justification
4. **Follow secure coding practices** outlined in [docs/security-scanning.md](docs/security-scanning.md)

### Secure Development Practices

- **No hardcoded credentials** - Use environment variables or secure vaults
- **Validate all inputs** - Never trust user-provided data
- **Use secure defaults** - Principle of least privilege
- **Error handling** - Always check and handle errors appropriately
- **Secure communication** - Use TLS 1.2+ for all network communications
- **File permissions** - Use restrictive permissions (600/640 for files, 750 for directories)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do NOT create a public GitHub issue**
2. **Email security issues** to the project maintainers
3. **Include detailed information**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Vulnerability assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix development**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: Within 24-48 hours
  - High: Within 1 week
  - Medium: Within 2 weeks
  - Low: Next regular release
- **Public disclosure**: After fix is available

### Security Advisory Process

1. **Vulnerability confirmed** - Private discussion with reporter
2. **Fix developed** - Security patch created and tested
3. **Release prepared** - Security update packaged
4. **Advisory published** - Public disclosure with CVE if applicable
5. **Notification sent** - Users notified of security update

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Token-based authentication** for API access
- **Environment variable configuration** for sensitive data
- **Role-based access control** where applicable

### Data Protection

- **No sensitive data logging** - Credentials and tokens are masked
- **Secure temporary files** - Proper cleanup and permissions
- **Configuration validation** - Input sanitization and validation

### Network Security

- **TLS encryption** for all HTTPS communications
- **Certificate validation** - No insecure skip verify
- **Timeout configurations** - Prevent resource exhaustion

### Infrastructure Security

- **Container security** - Minimal base images and non-root users
- **Dependency management** - Regular updates and vulnerability scanning
- **CI/CD security** - Secure build and deployment processes

## Vulnerability Management

### Dependency Scanning

```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
go list -json -deps ./... | nancy sleuth

# Update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities
go get -u ./...
go mod tidy
```

### Security Monitoring

- **Automated scanning** in CI/CD pipeline
- **Dependency vulnerability alerts** via GitHub
- **Code security analysis** on every commit
- **Regular security audits** by maintainers

## Compliance

This project follows security best practices from:

- **OWASP** - Open Web Application Security Project guidelines
- **NIST** - Cybersecurity Framework
- **CIS** - Center for Internet Security benchmarks
- **Go Security** - Go-specific security recommendations

## Security Tools

### Static Analysis

- **gosec** - Go security analyzer
- **golangci-lint** - Multiple security linters
- **nancy** - Dependency vulnerability scanner

### Dynamic Analysis

- **Container scanning** - Vulnerability detection in Docker images
- **Runtime monitoring** - Security event detection

### Development Tools

- **Pre-commit hooks** - Catch issues before commit
- **IDE integration** - Real-time security feedback
- **CI/CD integration** - Automated security gates

## Incident Response

### In Case of Security Incident

1. **Assess the impact** - Determine scope and severity
2. **Contain the issue** - Prevent further damage
3. **Investigate root cause** - Understand how it happened
4. **Implement fixes** - Address the vulnerability
5. **Monitor for recurrence** - Ensure fix is effective
6. **Document lessons learned** - Improve future security

### Communication Plan

- **Internal team** - Immediate notification
- **Users** - Transparent communication about impact
- **Community** - Public advisory after resolution
- **Authorities** - If required by law or regulation
