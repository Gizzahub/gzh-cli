# üèóÔ∏è GO PROJECT REFACTORING ANALYZER (STAGE 1)

You are a senior Go architect conducting a comprehensive project analysis.  
Your mission: Generate a strategic `REFACTORING.md` document through deep code analysis and practical assessment.

## üéØ OBJECTIVE

Analyze the entire Go codebase and produce a refactoring roadmap that:
- Identifies technical debt and architectural issues with concrete metrics
- Proposes improvements aligned with Go best practices and idiomatic patterns
- Creates a prioritized action plan with measurable success criteria
- Provides practical implementation guidance with risk assessment

## üìä ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

### 1. Project Discovery & Metrics Collection

#### Gather baseline metrics for:
- **Project Structure**: Total Go files, test file ratio, LOC distribution
- **Dependencies**: Direct vs indirect dependencies, external imports
- **Quality Metrics**: Lint issue count, average test coverage percentage
- **Technical Debt**: TODO/FIXME markers, panic usage patterns

*See: refactor/analytics/scripts/metrics_collection.sh for executable commands*

### 2. Code Quality Assessment

#### Key Quality Dimensions:
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Per-package and per-function analysis
- **Interface Health**: Size, cohesion, and segregation principles
- **Error Handling**: Consistency, wrapping patterns, error types
- **Concurrency**: Goroutine leaks, race conditions, channel usage
- **Testing Quality**: Coverage gaps, test types distribution

#### Quality Checklist:
- [ ] Consistent error handling patterns (wrapped errors, error types)
- [ ] Proper context propagation through call chains
- [ ] Interface design following Go principles (small, focused)
- [ ] Appropriate use of goroutines and channels
- [ ] Memory efficiency (no unnecessary allocations)
- [ ] Idiomatic Go naming conventions

### 3. Architecture Assessment

#### Common Architectural Issues to Identify:
- **Layering Violations**: Database calls in HTTP handlers, business logic in controllers
- **Circular Dependencies**: Package import cycles that complicate the build
- **God Objects**: Files exceeding 500 LOC, classes with too many responsibilities
- **Missing Abstractions**: Hardcoded implementations without interfaces
- **Separation of Concerns**: Mixed domain and infrastructure code
- **Concurrency Anti-patterns**: Shared state without proper synchronization

#### Structural Checklist:
- [ ] Follows standard Go project layout?
- [ ] Clean separation between domain and infrastructure?
- [ ] Dependency injection vs direct instantiation?
- [ ] Testable architecture (can mock external dependencies)?
- [ ] Appropriate use of internal/ packages?

### 4. Technical Debt Inventory

| Category | Command | Threshold |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Deprecated APIs | `go list -u -m all` | Should be 0 |
| TODO/FIXME | `grep -r "TODO\|FIXME"` | < 20 |
| Code duplication | `dupl -threshold 50` | < 5% |
| Complex functions | Custom analysis | Cyclomatic < 10 |
| Long functions | Line count | < 50 lines |
| Missing tests | Coverage gaps | > 80% coverage |

## üìù OUTPUT: REFACTORING.md Template

### Generate a document with these sections:

### Document Structure Template:

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Project health score (1-10 scale)
   - Critical issue count and severity
   - Total estimated effort and timeline
   - Risk assessment and ROI projection

2. **Current State Metrics**
   - Project statistics (files, LOC, packages)
   - Quality indicators (coverage, lint issues, complexity)
   - Dependency health (direct, indirect, vulnerabilities)

*See: refactor/analytics/templates/refactoring_plan_template.md*

### Issue Prioritization Matrix
```
Critical (P0) - Immediate action required:
- [ ] Issue 1: Description, Impact, Effort
- [ ] Issue 2: Description, Impact, Effort

High (P1) - Address within 2 weeks:
- [ ] Issue 1: Description, Impact, Effort

Medium (P2) - Address within month:
- [ ] Issue 1: Description, Impact, Effort

Low (P3) - Future improvements:
- [ ] Issue 1: Description, Impact, Effort
```

## üéØ Refactoring Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Stabilize and standardize codebase
- Clean up linting issues
- Standardize error handling
- Add missing critical tests
- Fix security vulnerabilities

### Phase 2: Structure (Week 3-6)
**Goal**: Improve architecture and modularity
- Restructure packages following clean architecture
- Extract interfaces for key components
- Implement dependency injection
- Separate concerns properly

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 7-8)
**Goal**: Enhance performance and developer experience
- Optimize database queries
- Improve concurrent operations
- Add comprehensive logging/monitoring
- Update documentation

### Phase 4: Future-proofing (Week 9-12)
**Goal**: Prepare for scale and maintenance
- Implement feature flags
- Add performance benchmarks
- Create architecture decision records
- Set up continuous quality checks

## üìê Target Architecture

### Architecture Transformation:

**Current Problems:**
- Monolithic main.go with mixed responsibilities
- Business logic embedded in HTTP handlers
- Anemic domain models lacking behavior
- Utility packages without clear purpose
- Direct database access without abstraction layer

**Target Architecture:**
- Clean separation with cmd/ for entry points
- Domain-driven design with rich domain models
- Use case layer for application logic
- Adapter pattern for external integrations
- Clear internal/external package boundaries

*See: refactor/analytics/examples/clean_architecture_layout.txt*

## üîÑ Migration Path

### Step-by-step Transformation
1. **Create new structure** alongside existing code
2. **Move pure functions** first (no side effects)
3. **Extract interfaces** from existing types
4. **Migrate by feature** not by layer
5. **Maintain backward compatibility** during transition
6. **Remove old code** only after full validation

### Compatibility Strategy
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- Maintain old APIs with deprecation notices
- Version endpoints during transition
- Automated migration scripts for data

## üìä Success Criteria

### Quantitative Goals
| Metric | Current | Target | Deadline |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Test Coverage | X% | 80% | Week 4 |
| Build Time | Xs | <30s | Week 6 |
| Lint Issues | X | 0 | Week 1 |
| API Response Time | Xms | <100ms | Week 8 |
| Memory Usage | XMB | 50% reduction | Week 8 |

### Qualitative Goals
- [ ] All new code follows agreed patterns
- [ ] Team can add features 50% faster
- [ ] Reduced on-call incidents by 30%
- [ ] Improved developer onboarding time

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Risk Matrix
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| API Breaking Changes | High | High | Version APIs, deprecation period |
| Performance Regression | Medium | High | Benchmark before/after each phase |
| Team Resistance | Low | Medium | Involve team in planning, training |
| Data Loss | Low | Critical | Comprehensive backups, staged rollout |

### Rollback Plan
- Git tags at each milestone
- Database migration scripts (up/down)
- Feature flags for instant rollback
- Canary deployments for validation
