# üìö Go Project Refactoring Guide - Phase 3

This directory contains a comprehensive 3-stage refactoring process for Go projects, consolidated from best practices and practical implementations.

## üìã Overview

The refactoring process is divided into three sequential stages:

1. **REFACTOR1**: Analysis & Planning
2. **REFACTOR2**: Checklist Generation  
3. **REFACTOR3**: Execution & Verification

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure

### Consolidated Versions (Recommended)
- `REFACTOR1_CONSOLIDATED.md` - Comprehensive project analysis and planning
- `REFACTOR2_CONSOLIDATED.md` - Detailed checklist generation from the plan
- `REFACTOR3_CONSOLIDATED.md` - Systematic execution with validation

### Korean Reference
- `REFACTOR1_CONSOLIDATED_KO.md` - Korean reference for Stage 1
- Additional `_KO.md` files can be created as needed

### Legacy Versions
- `REFACTOR[1-3].md` - Original English versions
- `22/REFACTOR[1-3].md` - Korean versions with practical examples

## üöÄ How to Use

### Stage 1: Analysis & Planning
1. Start with `REFACTOR1_CONSOLIDATED.md`
2. Run the analysis commands to gather metrics
3. Generate a comprehensive `REFACTORING.md` document
4. Review with your team and get approval

### Stage 2: Checklist Generation
1. Use `REFACTOR2_CONSOLIDATED.md` with your `REFACTORING.md`
2. Break down high-level goals into executable tasks
3. Create `REFACTORING_CHECKLIST.md` with dependencies
4. Estimate time and assign priorities

### Stage 3: Execution & Verification
1. Follow `REFACTOR3_CONSOLIDATED.md` for systematic execution
2. Execute tasks in order, validating each step
3. Use provided scripts for automation
4. Generate execution reports

## üìä Key Features

### Consolidated Versions Include:
- **Reference-Based Approach**: Code examples moved to separate files
- **Cleaner Prompts**: Focus on strategy and patterns, not implementation
- **Modular Resources**: Reusable templates and scripts
- **Validation Framework**: Automated testing at each step
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time monitoring dashboards
- **Risk Assessment**: Categorized approach based on risk level

### Recent Improvements:
- **Removed Embedded Code**: All code examples extracted to `resources/`
- **Added References**: Prompts now reference external files
- **Improved Maintainability**: Code and prompts can evolve independently
- **Better Organization**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Enhanced Reusability**: Templates can be used across projects

## üõ†Ô∏è Required Tools

- Go 1.21+
- golangci-lint
- Standard Unix tools (grep, sed, awk)
- git
- Optional: jq, yq, bc

## üìà Expected Outcomes

After completing all three stages:
- Improved code structure following Go best practices
- Increased test coverage (target: 80%+)
- Reduced technical debt
- Better performance metrics
- Standardized patterns across codebase
- Comprehensive documentation

## üîó Integration with Analytics Module

The `refactor/analytics/` directory contains:
- **Go Module**: Complete analytics tool for refactoring
- **Examples**: All code snippets referenced in prompts
- **Templates**: Reusable document templates
- **Scripts**: Automation scripts for common tasks
- **Analysis Tools**: Complexity and metrics analyzers

## üîÑ Workflow Example

The complete refactoring workflow follows three stages:
1. **Analysis**: Project state assessment and goal definition
2. **Planning**: Executable checklist generation with dependencies
3. **Execution**: Automated task execution with validation

*See: refactor/analytics/scripts/refactoring_workflow.sh*

## üìö Additional Resources

- See `extended-verification/` for automated analysis tools
- Check individual files for detailed examples
- Korean speakers can reference `_KO.md` files

## ü§ù Contributing

When adding improvements:
1. Update the consolidated versions
2. Maintain backward compatibility
3. Add practical examples
4. Include validation steps
5. Document in both English and Korean (if possible)

üí° **Note**: The consolidated versions represent the best of both theoretical framework and practical implementation, suitable for production use in enterprise Go projects.
