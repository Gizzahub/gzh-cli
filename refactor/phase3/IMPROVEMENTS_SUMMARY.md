# Refactor Phase3 Improvements Summary

## Overview

The refactor/phase3 prompts have been significantly improved to remove embedded source code and adopt a reference-based approach. This makes the prompts cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to use.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Extracted Code to Separate Files
All source code examples have been moved from the prompt files to dedicated directories:
- `resources/examples/` - Contains executable code examples
- `resources/templates/` - Contains reusable document templates

### 2. Reference-Based Approach
Instead of embedding code directly in prompts, the improved versions now reference external files:
- Example: "See: refactor/analytics/scripts/metrics_collection.sh"
- This allows code to be tested and maintained independently

### 3. Cleaner, More Focused Prompts
The prompts now focus on:
- Strategy and approach
- Patterns and principles
- Decision criteria
- Workflow descriptions

### 4. Better Organization

```

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Code and prompts can evolve independently
2. **Reusability**: Templates and examples can be used across projects
3. **Testability**: Code examples can be tested separately
4. **Clarity**: Prompts are easier to read without embedded code
5. **Version Control**: Better diff visibility for changes

## Usage Pattern

1. Read the prompt for strategy and approach
2. Reference the external files for implementation details
3. Copy and adapt templates for your project
4. Execute scripts directly from the resources directory

## Migration Guide

If you were using the old prompts with embedded code:
1. The strategy and approach remain the same
2. Look for "See: refactor/analytics/..." references
3. Find the actual code in the analytics module
4. Templates provide structure for your documents
5. Use the analytics CLI tool for additional analysis

## Future Improvements

- Add more language-specific examples
- Create project-type specific templates
- Build automated tooling around the templates
- Add validation scripts for each phase
