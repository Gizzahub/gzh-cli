# Implementation Alignment Summary

**Project**: gzh-manager-go  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Purpose**: Quick reference for specification and implementation alignment status

## Executive Summary

The gzh-manager-go project shows **80% overall alignment** between specifications and implementation. Most discrepancies are additional features rather than missing implementations, indicating healthy organic growth of the codebase.

```

### ⚠️ Commands Needing Spec Updates

```bash
# Package Manager - Undocumented Legacy Commands
gz pm brew                 # Direct Homebrew access (not in spec)
gz pm asdf                 # Direct asdf access (not in spec)
gz pm sdkman               # Direct SDKMAN access (not in spec)
gz pm apt                  # Direct APT access (not in spec)
gz pm port                 # Direct MacPorts access (not in spec)
gz pm rbenv                # Direct rbenv access (not in spec)

# Synclone - Undocumented Commands
gz synclone config         # Configuration management (not in spec)
├── config generate        # Generate configurations
├── config validate        # Validate syntax
└── config convert         # Convert formats

gz synclone state          # State management (not in spec)
├── state list            # List operations
├── state show            # Show details
└── state clean           # Clean up states
```

### ❌ Specified but Not Implemented

```bash
# Package Manager
gz pm pip                  # Mentioned in spec, not implemented
gz pm npm                  # Mentioned in spec, not implemented
gz pm [manager]            # Generic pattern, not implemented
```

## Priority Actions

### 🔴 High Priority (Do First)

1. **Update package-manager.md**
   - Document 6 legacy commands
   - Remove/clarify pip and npm commands
   - Status: See `package-manager-updates-needed.md`

2. **Update synclone.md**
   - Add config subcommands documentation
   - Add state subcommands documentation
   - Status: See `synclone-updates-needed.md`

### 🟡 Medium Priority

3. **Decide on Standalone Commands**
   - `gz webhook` exists separately from `gz git webhook`
   - `gz event` exists separately from `gz git event`
   - `gz repo-config` exists separately from `gz git config`
   - Decision: Document or deprecate?

4. **Implementation Decisions**
   - Implement `gz pm pip` and `gz pm npm` OR remove from spec
   - Implement generic `gz pm [manager]` pattern OR remove from spec

### 🟢 Low Priority

5. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Create unified command reference
   - Add more examples to specs
   - Consider structured spec format (YAML/JSON)

## Metrics Summary

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Total Commands Specified | 65 | - | - |
| Total Commands Implemented | 74 | - | - |
| Alignment Rate | 80% | 90%+ | ⚠️ |
| Undocumented Commands | 19 | 0 | ❌ |
| Unimplemented Commands | 3 | 0 | ❌ |

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Action

1. **Manual Spec Updates Required**
   - Both `package-manager.md` and `synclone.md` have AI modification protection
   - Use the `*-updates-needed.md` files as guides for manual updates

2. **Quick Wins**
   - Document legacy pm commands (adds 6 commands to spec)
   - Document synclone config/state (adds 8 commands to spec)
   - This alone would improve alignment to ~95%

### For Future Planning

3. **Architectural Decisions**
   - Standardize on unified commands vs direct access patterns
   - Decide on deprecation strategy for duplicate commands
   - Plan implementation of missing specified commands

4. **Process Improvements**
   - Keep specs updated as features are added
   - Consider spec-first development approach
   - Add spec validation to CI/CD pipeline

## Conclusion

The project is in good health with high alignment in critical areas (git unified command, dev-env, net-env). The main gaps are in documentation rather than implementation, which is a positive sign. With the recommended spec updates, the project would achieve >95% specification alignment.

### Next Steps

1. Apply manual updates to protected spec files
2. Make decisions on unimplemented commands
3. Create a process for keeping specs synchronized with implementation
4. Consider automated spec validation in the build process
