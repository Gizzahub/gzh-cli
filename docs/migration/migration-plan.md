# GZH Manager Command Consolidation Migration Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the phased migration plan to consolidate GZH Manager from 18 commands to 10 commands, improving usability while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Implementation (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal**: Implement new command structure alongside existing commands

#### Tasks:
1. Add subcommands to target commands:
   - `synclone config generate` (from gen-config)
   - `repo-sync config|webhook|event` (from repo-config, webhook, event)
   - `dev-env ssh` (from ssh-config)
   - Individual `config` subcommands for each command

2. Create shared code packages:
   - Extract common configuration logic
   - Create validation framework
   - Implement command routing utilities

3. Implement global `validate` command

4. Convert `shell` to debug flag

#### Success Criteria:
- All new commands functional
- Existing commands unchanged
- No breaking changes

### Phase 2: Testing & Validation (Week 3)
**Goal**: Ensure new structure works correctly

#### Tasks:
1. Unit tests for all new subcommands
2. Integration tests for command routing
3. Performance benchmarking
4. User acceptance testing with select users

#### Success Criteria:
- 100% test coverage for new code
- No performance regression
- Positive feedback from test users

### Phase 3: Documentation & Communication (Week 4)
**Goal**: Prepare users for migration

#### Tasks:
1. Update all documentation
2. Create migration guide
3. Prepare video tutorials
4. Draft announcement blog post

#### Deliverables:
- Updated README.md
- Command-specific documentation
- Migration guide with examples
- FAQ document

### Phase 4: Deprecation Implementation (Week 5)
**Goal**: Guide users to new commands

#### Tasks:
1. Add deprecation warnings to old commands
2. Implement command aliases
3. Create automatic migration script
4. Add telemetry for deprecated command usage

#### Features:
```bash
$ gz gen-config
Warning: 'gen-config' is deprecated and will be removed in v3.0.
Please use 'gz synclone config generate' instead.
Run 'gz help migrate' for more information.

[Command continues to work]
```

### Phase 5: Rollout & Monitoring (Week 6+)
**Goal**: Monitor adoption and gather feedback

#### Tasks:
1. Release v2.0.0 with dual command support
2. Monitor deprecated command usage
3. Collect user feedback
4. Address issues and concerns

#### Metrics to Track:
- Deprecated command usage percentage
- User issue reports
- Migration script usage
- Support ticket volume

## Command Migration Map

| Old Command | New Command | Migration Complexity |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| `gen-config` | `synclone config generate` | Low |
| `repo-config` | `repo-sync config` | Low |
| `event` | `repo-sync event` | Low |
| `webhook` | `repo-sync webhook` | Low |
| `ssh-config` | `dev-env ssh` | Low |
| `config` | `[command] config` | Medium |
| `doctor` | `validate` / `[command] validate` | Medium |
| `shell` | `--debug-shell` | Low |
| `migrate` | Hidden/Script | Low |

## Backward Compatibility Strategy

### 1. Command Aliases (6 months)
- Shell aliases for all deprecated commands
- Automatic installation via migration script
- Clear deprecation warnings

### 2. Environment Variables
- `GZH_ALLOW_DEPRECATED=1` to suppress warnings
- `GZH_FORCE_NEW_COMMANDS=1` to disable old commands

### 3. Version Detection
- Detect if scripts use old commands
- Suggest updates via warnings
- Provide migration assistance

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks:
1. **User Scripts Breaking**
   - Mitigation: 6-month deprecation period
   - Aliases for smooth transition

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Failures**
   - Mitigation: Environment variable to suppress warnings
   - Gradual rollout to test environments first

3. **Documentation Confusion**
   - Mitigation: Clear migration guide
   - Prominent warnings in old docs

4. **Support Burden**
   - Mitigation: Automated migration tools
   - Comprehensive FAQ

### Rollback Plan:
1. All changes behind feature flags
2. Can revert to v1.x behavior via config
3. Dual command support for extended period
4. Clear rollback procedures documented

## Communication Timeline

### T-4 weeks: Pre-announcement
- Beta testing with key users
- Gather feedback and adjust

### T-2 weeks: Announcement
- Blog post explaining changes
- Email to registered users
- Social media announcement

### T-0: Release
- v2.0.0 with dual command support
- Migration tools available
- Support channels ready

### T+2 weeks: Follow-up
- Usage metrics review
- Address common issues
- Update documentation based on feedback

### T+3 months: Deprecation Warning
- Increase warning visibility
- Reminder communications
- Plan for old command removal

### T+6 months: Command Removal
- Release v3.0.0
- Remove old commands
- Maintain aliases only

## Success Metrics

1. **Adoption Rate**: 80% using new commands within 3 months
2. **Support Tickets**: <10% increase during migration
3. **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on simplified structure
4. **Script Updates**: 90% of active users updated within 6 months

## Contingency Plans

### If adoption is low:
- Extend deprecation period
- Improve migration tools
- Additional user education

### If critical issues found:
- Immediate patch release
- Extend dual command support
- Re-evaluate consolidation plan

### If strong user resistance:
- Community discussion
- Possible retention of some old commands
- Adjusted consolidation strategy
