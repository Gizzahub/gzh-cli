# UC-001: Invalid visibility filter defaults to include all

- **ID**: UC-001
- **Title**: Invalid visibility filter defaults to include all
- **Scenario**: `VisibilityFilter.ShouldIncludeRepository` is called with an unknown filter value.
- **Preconditions**: A `VisibilityFilter` has `Filter` set to a value outside `public`, `private`, or `all`.
- **Steps**:
  1. Create a `VisibilityFilter` with an invalid value (e.g. `"invalid"`).
  2. Invoke `ShouldIncludeRepository` for a repository.
- **Expected Result**: The function returns `true`, meaning the repository is included.
- **Exceptions / Boundary Cases**: The filter value is invalid or empty.
- **Notes**: Prevents accidental exclusion when the filter is misconfigured.
