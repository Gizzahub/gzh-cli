## N

**netenv**
: The internal package that handles network environment utilities, configuration management, and network-related operations.

**Network Environment (net-env)**
: Network environment management through interactive TUI dashboard, status monitoring, profile management, network actions, and cloud integration. Advanced features like automatic WiFi detection and complex VPN management are planned for future releases.

## O

**Organization**
: A Git platform entity that contains multiple repositories and can be managed as a unit through bulk operations.

**Output Format**
: The presentation style for command results, supporting table, JSON, YAML, CSV, and HTML formats.

## P

**Package Manager (PM)**
: Tools for managing software dependencies and runtime environments, including asdf, Homebrew, SDKMAN, npm, pip, and others.

**Policy Validation**
: The process of checking whether repositories comply with defined organizational policies and security requirements.

**Provider Registry**
: The system that manages and instantiates different Git platform implementations at runtime.

## Q

**Quality Management**
: The integrated system for running code quality checks, security scans, and compliance validations across multiple programming languages.

## R

**Rate Limiting**
: The mechanism for respecting API quotas and preventing excessive requests to Git platform services.

**Repository Configuration (repo-config)**
: Settings and policies applied to individual repositories, including webhooks, branch protection, and Actions policies.

**Resumable Clone**
: A feature that allows interrupted cloning operations to be resumed from the last successful state, preventing data loss and reducing restart time.

**RuleManager**
: The component responsible for managing automation rules, evaluating conditions, and executing actions in the GitHub automation system.

## S

**Schema Validation**
: The process of verifying that configuration files match expected structure and contain valid data types and values.

**Secure Git Executor**
: A security-hardened component that safely executes git commands while preventing command injection and validating inputs.

**strconv**
: Go standard library package for string conversions (e.g., string to integer), heavily used in parsing configuration values and API responses.

**Synclone**
: The primary bulk operation for synchronizing repositories from Git platform organizations to local filesystem with various strategies.

**Strategy Pattern**
: The design approach used for Git operations where different update strategies (rebase, reset, pull, etc.) can be selected based on requirements.
